# CV_Diana

Resume

This is achieved by directing the output of your rmarkdown file to
`awesome.tex` which controls format and styles:

    output:
      pdf_document:
        latex_engine: xelatex
        template: "awesome.tex"

My CV was made using the `vitae` and `googlesheets4` package for R.  
The link of the resume is just clicking the image below. ðŸ‘‡
